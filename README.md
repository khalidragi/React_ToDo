# Simple React To-Do app

This is a simple To-Do app, I create it as a part of my learning **React JS**, it is a very simple app to implement my first knowledge to **React JS**.

## Concepts Learned

I learned lots of useful aspects of **React JS** in this project:

> + Using create-react-app.
> + Understanding project structure.
> + Practicing with **JSX**
> + Using state and props.
> + Components usage and linking them by importing or passing props.
> + Event handling.
> + Master ES6+ Features Like _Arrow Functions_, _High order functions_, _Spread_ and _Destructuring_.
> + Including Semantic UI to the project.
> + **Git** usage by pushing the project to **GitHub** by SSH.

## Next Steps

> + Building another app with Redux and Router.
> + Deploy site through **Netlify**.
> + Using Firebase.

## Built With

> + [React JS](https://reactjs.org/).
